# covid-19-lasercut-face-mask

This is our take on the great laser cut mask that Kitronic, Nottingham Hackspace and Smoke & Mirrors have created.  We have made some adjustments to better suit our laser cutting setup

Adaptations
- lengthened the adjustable strap to accomodate larger heads
- removed two support bands to reduce the width and fit better on the glowforges cutting bed
- coloured the lines to define a cutting order
- adjusted a couple cutting lines to increase cutting speed by forcing a further optimised cutting path
